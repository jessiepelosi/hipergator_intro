# 1. Logging In and Moving Around 

## Accessing the Command Line
<b>Windows:</b>

Using the command line on Windows machines is a bit different than using a Mac or Linux machine. If you are using Windows 10, search (using the search bar on the bottom left of the taskbar for "CMD". Open the application called "Command Prompt". You should be able to continue to the next step. If you are not able to do so, you may have to install [PuTTY](https://putty.org/) or [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/).  

<b>Mac:</b>

On a Mac/Linux machine, you can log into HiPerGator using the "Terminal" application. Once you've opened the Terminal, you can continue to the next step. 

## Logging In
<b> Windows 10 or Mac/Linux </b>

Once you're in the Command Prompt or Terminal, type the following and hit enter (replace "username" with your GatorLink username). 

```
ssh username@hpg.rc.ufl.edu
```

When prompted, type in your password. 

<b> Windows SSH Client </b>
Open your SSH client program. I'll be using PuTTY for this example. You should see the following screen:
![alt text](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/hipergator_intro/blob/main/putty.png "PuTTY example")

To log in, type the following into the box under "Host Name (or IP address)" (replace "username" with your GatorLink username):

```
username@hpg.rc.ufl.edu
```

You should see a terminal window pop up and ask for your password.

If you want to save this address so that you don't have to type it in every time, type a nickname for the login address in the box under "Saved Sessions" and click "Save" to the right.


## Navigating HiperGator
You'll be moved into your home directory, but do not do any work in this directory! You'll have a directory within your PI's cluster. The `cd` command stands for "change directory". For example: 
```
cd /blue/sessa/username
  
cd /blue/barbazuk/username
```
Once you're in your directory within your PI's cluster, you can make folders, files, etc. Let's start by making a new folder called "scratch".
``` 
mkdir scatch
```
Now to make sure you made that folder, you can use the `ls` command to list the contents of your directory. There's some extra "flags" or extra semantics to pass to the command. With `ls` I tend to use two flags that you can combine, the `-l` for the "long version" of the listing, and `-h` for a human-readable list view. Try them out! 
``` 
ls 
ls -l 
ls -h
ls -lh 
```

You can also use an asterisk (*) as a wild card with several commands. For example, if we want to list all the files that end in ".txt" we can type:
```
ls *.txt 
```
This will list all the files with the ".txt" ending! 

You can list the sum of the file sizes using the following command: 
```
du -h
```
This will tell you the combined size of all the files in that directory in a human-readable format. 

If you want to move into your new "scratch" folder, you can simply: 
```
cd scratch 
```
Now if you type `ls` you'll notice that nothing is in this folder yet! If you want to go back one step to your folder in your PI's cluster, you can use `cd` again, but instead of typing the whole path (e.g., `cd /blue/barbazuk/username`), use can use a relative path. 
```
cd ..
```
The double periods signify the directory right above the one you are currently in. A single period (`.`) signifies the directory you are currently in.

You can move multiple directories up with relative paths. For example, if you want to move two directories up (instead of one), you can do so like this: 
```
cd ../..
```
You can continue to string together `..` (separated by `/`) to continue to move up in the directory hierarchy. 

To see where you are at any time, you can use the "print working directory command" `pwd`. 
```
pwd
```

Once you're comforatable with moving around and making directories, you'll want to clone (or copy) this repository into your directory so you have a copy. Use this command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jessiepelosi/hipergator_intro.git
```
Now you can `cd` into the new directory, all you'll have all the files for the rest of this tutorial!

# Introduction to Using HiPerGator/Unix Machines 

This is a general introduction for using the University of Florida's HiPerGator Computing Cluster/Unix Machines. There are folders for each step, listed below. I tried to include practice files where possible (starting with #2. Copying, Editing, and Moving Files). Each step contains a markdown file (ends in .md)- use this to guide your progress as you work through. This is a work in progress- don't hesitate to reach out (jessiepelosi@ufl.edu) with any questions, conerns, or comments!

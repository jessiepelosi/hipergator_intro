# 0. Your Computer  

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to: 

   * Download and work with a plain text editor
   * Access the command line on your machine
   * Move files between your computer and the computing cluster

## Text Editor
You'll need a basic understanding of your own computer before being able to log into HiPerGator. I've split this up into Mac/Linux and Windows. You'll also want to download a text editor - you shouldn't write code in Microsoft Word! Here are some text editors that I've used before and work pretty well: 
1. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Text Wrangler/BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) 
4. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) 

It is okay to write your code in any of these text editors (or use built-in ones on HiPerGator) and then transfer that text to a Word document to keep track of what you've done.

<u>Note for Windows users</u>: once you've chosen and downloaded a text-editing software, I would recommend going into the Settings menu and making sure that the default for end-of-line (EOL) character is set to Unix/Linus (\n) rather than Windows (\r\n). This will make any files you create locally compatible with HiperGator from the start.

## Accessing the Command Line
HiperGator isn't like many personal computers, in that you usually cannot interact with it using a mouse to click on things. Instead, it must be navigated using the command line. Everything you want to do, from moving between folders, to running programs, to editing text, must be done by typing a command into a terminal.

<b> Windows </b>

If you are using Windows 10, search "CMD" (using the search bar on the bottom left of the taskbar or hitting the Windows key). Open the application called "Command Prompt". You should be able to continue to the next step (#1 Logging In and Moving Around). If you are not able to do so, you may have to install an SSH client such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) or [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

<b> Mac/Linux </b>

Accessing the command line: On a Mac/Linux machine, you can log into HiPerGator using the "Terminal" application. Once you've opened the Terminal, you can continue to the next step (#1. Logging In and Moving Around). 

## Moving Files

<b> Windows </b> 

In order to transfer files between your computer and the cluster, you'll need to download a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client. Some commonly used SFTP clients are: 
1. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/free_sftp_client_for_windows)
    Note: Has a user-friendly drag-and-drop graphical user interface which visually resembles the Windows folder system. 
2. [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) 
3. [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
    Note: The recommended distribution of PuTTY comes with both a program for interacting with HiperGator via the command line and a program for secure file transfer.

Connect to hpg.rc.ufl.edu using one of these clients following their instructions. You want to make sure you are connecting through SFTP (you should be connecting through Port 22). Log in with your GatorLink username and password. 

<b> Mac/Linux </b> 

In order to transfer files between your computer and the cluster, you'll need to download a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client. A commonly used SFTP client on Mac/Linux machines is [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/). Connect to hpg.rc.ufl.edu using one of these clients following their inscructions. You want omake sure you are connecting through SFTP (you should be connecting through Port 22). Log in with your GatorLink username and password.

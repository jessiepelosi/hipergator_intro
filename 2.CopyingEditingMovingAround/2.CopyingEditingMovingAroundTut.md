# 2. Copying, Editing, and Moving Files 

Although you can make files using a file-transfer program such as WinSCP, you can also make new files right from the command line. I prefer to use the program `nano` which is already installed on HiPerGator from every log-in node. You can make a new file like this: 
```
nano myfile 
```
`nano` will then bring you to a new screen where you can edit the text file. You'll see something like this: 

![alt text](https://github.com/jessiepelosi/hipergator_intro/blob/main/nano.PNG "nano example")

You can add text just by typing. When you're done adding text, press Control + X at the same time and save the file. Unlike other programs, `nano` tells you what each command does! 

Now that you're out of the `nano` screen, you can copy your new file to your scratch folder like so: 
```
cp myfile scratch/
```
Now change your directory into the scratch folder and list the contents! Try it out first, but the commands are below too. 
```
cd scratch
ls -lh 
```
You can also rename and move your copy; these two processes are in a single command, `mv`. Let's first rename the file: 
```
mv myfile myfile_1
```
In this example, `mv` is the command and it takes two arguments: the first is the current name of the file, the second is the new name. We wanted to first rename the file so when we move it back to your main directory, we don't overwrite the previous version. We can do this: 
```
mv myfile_1 ../
```
Often the files we work with are too long to display on the screen, so we can view parts of them using the `head` and `tail` commands. `head` will display the first ten lines of a file, while `tail` will display the last ten lines of a file. 
```
head myfile_1 
tail myfile_1
```
The `less` command is a bit more flexible. You can try using `less` by changing into the "2Practice" folder and using the following commands:
```
cd 2Practice/
less practice.txt 
```
`less` shows as much of the file that will fit on your screen. You can move down the file line by line by pressing Enter. Once you are done, you can exit `less` box by pressing "q". 

If you want to know how many lines, words, or characters are in a file, you can use the `wc` command (with various flags):
```
wc myfile_1
wc -l myfile_1
wc -c myfile_1
```
If you're not sure how to use a command or what the flags mean, you can often type `--help` after the command:
```
wc --help
```
This will display general information about the command, flags, and arguments that the command takes. You can always use Google! You're soon realize that learning to efficiently Google will be a key skill in any type of coding. 

One of the most useful tips for working on the command line is using the Tab key to auto-complete file and directory names! Try typing this (but don't hit enter yet):
```
cd sc
```
Then press Tab on your keyboard: it will autocomplete the name of the directory (since it's the only thing in your main directory that starts with "sc"). Then hit enter! 

# Exercises 

Now it's time to give it a try! 

`cd` into the "2.CopyingEditingMovingAround" folder. List the contents of the directory. What is in this directory? 

Next `cd` into the "2Practice" folder. List the contents of the directory. What is in this directory? 

How many lines are there in the file "practice.txt"? How many words? 

Edit the "practice.txt" file with nano, adding the text "I am editing this file with nano!". Save the file as "practice_edited.txt". 

Make a new directory "PracticeDirectory" and move your "practice_edited.txt" into this new directory.
